# Security Audit Report - Plugcraft Website

**Date:** 2025-10-28  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Completed

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive security audit and code quality analysis of the Plugcraft website. The audit identified several critical security issues, code quality concerns, and areas for improvement. Most critical issues have been addressed in this PR, with remaining items documented for future consideration.

## Critical Security Issues Fixed

### 1. Security Headers (HIGH PRIORITY) ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** Missing security headers exposed the application to various attacks including XSS, clickjacking, and MIME sniffing.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added comprehensive security headers in `next.config.js`:
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME sniffing
  - `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Enables XSS protection
  - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Limits referer information
  - `Permissions-Policy` - Restricts browser features
  - `Content-Security-Policy` - Comprehensive CSP policy

**Files Changed:**
- `next.config.js` - Added headers() function
- `lib/security-headers.ts` - Created reusable security header utility

### 2. Environment Variable Validation (HIGH PRIORITY) ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** Missing or invalid environment variables could cause runtime errors and security issues. No validation occurred before app startup.

**Fix Applied:**
- Created `lib/env-validation.ts` with comprehensive environment variable validation
- Validates required variables at startup
- Provides clear error messages when variables are missing or invalid
- Caches validated environment variables for performance

**Files Changed:**
- `lib/env-validation.ts` - New validation module
- All API routes updated to use `getEnvVars()`

### 3. Input Validation and Sanitization (HIGH PRIORITY) ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** User inputs were not properly validated or sanitized, exposing the application to injection attacks.

**Fix Applied:**
- Created `lib/security-headers.ts` with sanitization utilities:
  - `sanitizeEmail()` - Validates and normalizes email addresses
  - `sanitizeString()` - Removes dangerous characters from strings
  - `extractBearerToken()` - Safely extracts authentication tokens
  - `validateRequestSize()` - Prevents DOS via large payloads

**Files Changed:**
- All API routes updated to use sanitization functions
- Email inputs sanitized across the application
- Request size limits enforced (default 100KB)

### 4. Insecure Cookie Settings (MEDIUM PRIORITY) ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** Cookies used SameSite=Lax which is vulnerable to certain CSRF attacks.

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed all cookie settings to use `SameSite=Strict`
- Maintains Secure flag in production
- Consistent cookie settings across all device trust endpoints

**Files Changed:**
- `pages/api/confirm-device.ts`
- `pages/api/revoke-device.ts`

### 5. Information Disclosure (MEDIUM PRIORITY) ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** Admin check endpoint leaked debug information in non-production environments.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed debug information from admin check responses
- Improved error messages to avoid leaking sensitive details
- Consistent error handling across all API endpoints

**Files Changed:**
- `pages/api/admin/check.ts`
- All API routes updated with generic error messages

### 6. TypeScript Strict Mode (MEDIUM PRIORITY) ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** TypeScript was running in non-strict mode, allowing type safety issues to slip through.

**Fix Applied:**
- Enabled TypeScript strict mode in `tsconfig.json`
- Added additional compiler flags:
  - `noUnusedLocals: true`
  - `noUnusedParameters: true`
  - `noImplicitReturns: true`
  - `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch: true`
- Fixed all resulting type errors across the codebase
- Removed unused variables and imports

**Files Changed:**
- `tsconfig.json`
- 12+ component and page files

## Security Issues Requiring Attention

### 1. Deprecated Dependencies (HIGH PRIORITY) ⚠️ NOT YET FIXED
**Issue:** Using `@supabase/auth-helpers-react@0.5.0` which is deprecated and may have security vulnerabilities.

**Recommendation:**
```bash
npm install @supabase/ssr
```

Update authentication patterns to use the new `@supabase/ssr` package. This requires refactoring authentication logic across the application.

**Impact:** Medium - The deprecated package may not receive security updates.

**Effort:** High - Requires significant refactoring of authentication flows.

### 2. Rate Limiting (MEDIUM PRIORITY) ⚠️ PARTIAL FIX
**Issue:** Only one endpoint (`check-device.ts`) has rate limiting. Other sensitive endpoints are vulnerable to abuse.

**Recommendation:**
Implement rate limiting on these endpoints:
- `/api/create-device-token`
- `/api/confirm-device`
- `/api/download`
- `/api/record-session`
- All `/api/admin/*` endpoints

Consider using Redis or a similar external service for production rate limiting instead of in-memory maps.

**Sample Implementation:**
```typescript
// lib/rate-limiter.ts
export class RateLimiter {
  // Use Redis in production
  // Use Map in development/testing
}
```

### 3. CSRF Protection (MEDIUM PRIORITY) ⚠️ NOT YET FIXED
**Issue:** State-changing endpoints don't have explicit CSRF protection beyond SameSite cookies.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement CSRF token validation for all POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints
- Use double-submit cookie pattern or synchronizer token pattern
- Consider using a library like `csrf` or `csurf`

**Impact:** Medium - Mitigated by SameSite=Strict cookies but not fully protected.

### 4. Logging and Monitoring (LOW PRIORITY) ⚠️ NOT YET FIXED
**Issue:** No structured logging for security events.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement logging for:
  - Failed authentication attempts
  - Admin actions
  - Rate limit violations
  - Input validation failures
  - Suspicious activity patterns

**Sample Implementation:**
```typescript
// lib/security-logger.ts
export function logSecurityEvent(event: string, details: any) {
  console.log(JSON.stringify({
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    event,
    details,
    severity: 'security'
  }))
}
```

## Code Quality Improvements Applied

### 1. Removed Unused Code ✅ FIXED
- Removed unused imports across multiple files
- Removed unused state variables in components
- Removed unused function parameters
- Cleaned up dead code paths

### 2. Consistent Error Handling ✅ IMPROVED
- Standardized error responses across API routes
- Use generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
- Proper error logging with context

### 3. Code Organization ✅ IMPROVED
- Created reusable utility modules:
  - `lib/env-validation.ts`
  - `lib/security-headers.ts`
- Centralized security configuration

## Performance Recommendations

### 1. Database Query Optimization (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Current Issues:**
- Multiple sequential queries in some endpoints
- Missing database indexes may slow down queries

**Recommendations:**
1. Add indexes on frequently queried columns:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_profiles_user_id ON profiles(user_id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_usage_profile_id ON usage(profile_id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_trusted_devices_device_id ON trusted_devices(device_id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_trusted_devices_email ON trusted_devices(email);
   ```

2. Use batch queries where possible:
   ```typescript
   // Instead of multiple queries
   const { data: profile } = await supabase.from('profiles').select('*').eq('user_id', userId)
   const { data: usage } = await supabase.from('usage').select('*').eq('profile_id', profile.id)
   
   // Use a single join
   const { data } = await supabase
     .from('profiles')
     .select('*, usage(*)')
     .eq('user_id', userId)
   ```

### 2. Caching Strategy (LOW PRIORITY)
**Recommendations:**
- Cache public settings and announcements with appropriate TTL
- Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Use Next.js static generation for public pages

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Security Testing
- [ ] Penetration testing for authentication flows
- [ ] SQL injection testing (though Supabase RLS should protect)
- [ ] XSS testing on all user input fields
- [ ] CSRF testing on state-changing endpoints
- [ ] Rate limiting effectiveness testing

### 2. Integration Testing
- [ ] Test all API endpoints with invalid inputs
- [ ] Test authentication edge cases
- [ ] Test error handling paths
- [ ] Test rate limiting behavior

## Deployment Security Checklist

## Conclusion

This audit identified and fixed critical security vulnerabilities in the Plugcraft website. The most severe issues (missing security headers, inadequate input validation, and cookie security) have been addressed. The codebase is now significantly more secure and maintainable with TypeScript strict mode enabled.

However, some important work remains, particularly around updating deprecated dependencies, implementing comprehensive rate limiting, and adding proper security logging. These should be prioritized in the next development cycle.

The application follows security best practices in most areas, particularly with the use of Supabase RLS and proper separation of client and server-side operations. Continuing to invest in security and following the recommendations in this document will ensure the application remains secure as it grows.
